# About

When using External Controllers with the Steam Deck, sometimes the build in Steam Controller gets in the way by either not allowing the use of an External Controller at all, Having to Reassign Controller in the config each time you play a game, or interfering with Multiplayer games. This script simply listens to `udev` for when an External Controller is connected (either by Bluetooth or USB) then disables the Built in Steam Controller so that the (first) External Controller Defaults to Player One.

The Built in Steam Controller will be disabled until all External Controllers are disconnected.

# Currently Works With

Currently this script works with the following Bluetooth Controllers by default:
 - `Playstation 4 Controllers` (Identified as `Wireless Controller`) 
 - `Playstation 5 Controllers` (Identified as `Wireless Controller`) 
 - `Xbox One S/X Controllers` (Identified as `Xbox Wireless Controller`) 
 - `8BitDo SN30 gamepad`
 - And More! (see list below)

The script also works with the following USB Controllers by default:
 - `Wired XBox 360 Controllers` (Identified as `Microsoft X-Box 360 pad`) 
 - `Wireless XBox 360 Controllers (Via Dongle)` (Identified as `Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver`) 
 - And More! (see list below)

# Manually adding more Devices

To add more Bluetooth devices run `bluetoothctl devices` and add the name to `simple_device_list.txt` in `/home/deck/.local/share/scawp/SDADSC/`

To add more USB devices run `lsusb` and add the name to `simple_device_list.txt`

Default `simple_device_list.txt`
```

# Installation

## Via Curl (One Line Install)

In Konsole type `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/draksler/Steam-Deck.Auto-Disable-Steam-Controller/main/curl_install.sh | bash`

a `sudo` password is required (run `passwd` if required first)

# How to Temporarily Disable

`touch /home/deck/.local/share/scawp/SDADSC/conf/disabled`

to re-enable `rm /home/deck/.local/share/scawp/SDADSC/conf/disabled`

# Uninstallation

Run the following codes:

`sudo rm -r /home/deck/.local/share/scawp/SDADSC` #To delete the code

`sudo rm -r /etc/udev/rules.d/99-disable-steam-input.rules` #To delete the rule

`sudo udevadm control --reload` #To reload the service


You may need to reboot if you ran these lines when a bluetooth controller was connected.
